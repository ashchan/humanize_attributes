HumanizeAttributes
==================

Add humanity to Rails ActiveRecord column names.


Example
=======

	humanize_attributes :login => "User Name",
                    	:password => "Secret Key"

Look for a more elegant way?
=======

Rails 2.2 has brought us powerful I18N, now we can localize ActiveRecord model names very easily, just drop the following in the config/locales/en.yml:

	en:
	    activerecord:
	        models:
	            user: "Member"
	        attributes:
	            user:
	                login:		"User Name"
					password:	"Secret Key"
